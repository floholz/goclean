> Goclean is a tool written in golang, to clean up specified directories on a schedule. 

## Usage

```yaml
## docker-compose.yml

version: "3"

services:
  goclean:
    container_name: "goclean"
    image: floholz/goclean
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      - GO_CLEAN_PATHS="/mnt/goclean/dir1;/mnt/goclean/dir2"
      - GO_CLEAN_SCHEDULE="0 3 * * *"
      - GO_CLEAN_MAX_AGE=7d
    volumes:
      - ~/dir1:/mnt/goclean/dir1
      - ~/dir2:/mnt/goclean/dir2
```

## Environment Variables

Configuring `goclean` is done with environment variables.

### `GO_CLEAN_PATHS` (_required_)
This specifies what directories goclean should monitor. The paths need to be provided in a `;` seperated list.

_e.g.:_
```bash
GO_CLEAN_PATHS="/mnt/goclean/"
GO_CLEAN_PATHS="/mnt/goclean/dir1;/mnt/goclean/dir2"
GO_CLEAN_PATHS="/mnt/goclean/dir1;/mnt/goclean/dir2;/mnt/also_goclean/dir3"
```
<br>

### `GO_CLEAN_SCHEDULE`
You can specify your own schedule for clean up, by setting this environment variable. The value should be a `crontab` 
schedule string with an optional `seconds` parameter.

By default, the schedule is set to `0 0 * * *` meaning `daily at 00:00`.

_e.g.:_
```bash
GO_CLEAN_SCHEDULE="0 3 * * *"             # ‚ÄúDaily at 03:00.‚Äù
GO_CLEAN_SCHEDULE="*/30 */10 * * * WED"   # ‚ÄúEvery 30th second after every 10th minute on Wednesday.‚Äù
GO_CLEAN_SCHEDULE="55 15 14 1 8 *"        # ‚ÄúAt 14:15:55 on 1st of August.‚Äù
GO_CLEAN_SCHEDULE="0 22 * * 1-5"          # ‚ÄúAt 22:00 on every day-of-week from Monday through Friday.‚Äù
```
<br>

### `GO_CLEAN_MAX_AGE`
With this you can define the `maximum age` a file is allowed to have, before being deleted.
This uses the duration syntax, expanded by year, month and day.

By default, the maximum age for a file is set to `7d` meaning `7 days`.

_e.g.:_
```bash
GO_CLEAN_MAX_AGE="7d"               # ‚Äú7 days.‚Äù
GO_CLEAN_MAX_AGE="1y6m"             # ‚Äú1 year and 6 months.‚Äù
GO_CLEAN_MAX_AGE="11h59m59s"        # ‚Äú11 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds.‚Äù
GO_CLEAN_MAX_AGE="2y8m7d12h5m30s"   # ‚Äú2 years, 8 months, 7 days, 12 hours, 5 minutes and 30 seconds.‚Äù
```
